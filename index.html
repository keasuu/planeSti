        The SR-71 sas developed as a black projet fom the Lockheed A-12 reconnaissance aircraft during the 1960s by Lockheed's Skunk Works division. American aerospace engineer Clarence "Kelly‚Äù Johnson was responsible for many of the aircraft's innovative concepts. The shape of the SR-71 was based on that of the A-12, which was one of the first aircraft tobe designed with reduced radar cross-section. At one point, a bomber varinat of the aircraft was under consideration, before the program was focused solely on reconnaissance, Mission equipment forthe ecoansissance role included signals intelligence sensors, a side looking airborne radar, and a pote camera: the SR-71 was both longer aud heavier than the 12, allowing it hold more fel as well asa two-seat cockpit, The SR-71 designation has been atuibuted to lobbying efforts by USAF Chief of Staff General Cutis LeMay. who preferred the SR (Strategic Reconnaissance) designation over simply RS (Reconnaissance). The alrorafi was introduced to operational service in January 1966.
